# Time-Series-Analysis
Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to time series analysis, from basic concepts to advanced modeling techniques.

Learn the fundamental concepts of time series analysis, including the definition of time series data, key components (trend, seasonality, and residuals), and essential visualization techniques.

#### Decomposition and Stationarity
Explore the process of decomposing a time series into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, and residuals) and understand the concept of stationarity. Learn methods to test for stationarity and techniques to transform non-stationary data into a stationary form.

#### ARIMA model:
Dive into ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling, a powerful method for forecasting time series data. Understand the components of ARIMA (p, d, q), learn how to fit an ARIMA model to your data, and use it to make future predictions.
